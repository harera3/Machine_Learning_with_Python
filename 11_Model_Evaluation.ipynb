    "- When we have balanced classes (e.g. a roughly equal number of observations in each class of a target vector), accuracy is--just like in the binary class setting--a simple and interpretable choce for an evaluation metric. \n",
    "    - Accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the number of observations and works just as well in the multiclass as binary setting. \n",
    "- However, when we have imbalanced classes (a common scenario), we should be inclined to use other evaluation metrics.\n",
    "    - Precision, recall, and F1 scores are useful metrics. \n",
    "    - While all of them were originally designed for binary classifiers, we can apply them to multiclass settings by treating our data as a set of binary classes. \n",
